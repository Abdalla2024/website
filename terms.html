              account and we do not host your personal conversation data on our
              servers. Your preferences are stored locally on your device, and
              conversation data is processed temporarily for AI response
              generation only.
            </p>

              The App is for generating conversation responses only. It does not
              provide dating advice, relationship counseling, or guarantee
              romantic success. Generated responses are AI-created suggestions

              and customize all generated responses before use.
            </p>

            <h3>8.3 Service Availability</h3>
            <p>
              We do not guarantee that the App will be available at all times or

              components.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for

              content. Your use of third-party services is subject to their
              respective terms and privacy policies, including OpenAI's usage

            <p>
              These Terms apply to the extent permitted by the laws of your
              place of residence. If you reside in the United States, the laws
              of your state govern these Terms; otherwise, the laws of your
              country of residence apply. Mandatory consumer protections in your
              jurisdiction remain unaffected.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Severability</h2>
            <p>
