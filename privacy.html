            <h2>Who We Are & Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy explains how Rizz Bot ("we", "us") handles
              information for: (a) the Rizz Bot iOS application (the "App"), and
              (b) this marketing website (the "Website"). The App and Website
              have different data practices, which are described separately
              below.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="privacy-section">
            <h2>App (iOS) — What We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Dating conversation data:</strong> text input and
                screenshots you provide for AI response generation. This data is
                processed temporarily to generate responses and is not stored
                permanently. Your conversations and personal messages are not
                saved on our servers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage analytics:</strong> daily usage count, vibe
                preferences, and feature usage (stored locally on your device
                only using iOS UserDefaults).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Support communications:</strong> if you email us, we
                receive the information you include (e.g., your email address
                and message contents) to respond to your request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Diagnostics (optional):</strong> Apple crash reports and
                diagnostics if you opt in via iOS settings. These are provided
                by Apple and may include device information and OS version. We
                do not receive your personal conversation data in crash reports.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>No account required:</strong> The App does not require you
              to create an account with us, and we do not collect your name or
              other personal identifiers for App usage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Subscription data:</strong> If you purchase a premium
              subscription ($3.99/week or $19.99 lifetime), payment processing
              is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We receive
              anonymous subscription validation receipts but no payment details.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AI Processing:</strong> When you generate responses, your
              input text is sent to OpenAI's servers for processing using their
              GPT-4o-mini model. This data is processed according to OpenAI's
              privacy policy and is not used to train their models.

                <strong>Provide App features:</strong> generate AI-powered
                dating responses, process conversation screenshots with OCR, and
                track usage limits locally on your device.

                <strong>AI Response Generation:</strong> send your conversation
                text to OpenAI's servers to generate contextually appropriate

                and privacy.

                level).

            <h2>Storage & Security</h2>
            <h3>On your device</h3>
            <p>
              App data is stored locally within the App's iOS sandbox on your
              device and benefits from your device's security protections (such
              as passcode and Face ID/Touch ID) and iOS app sandboxing.
            </p>
            <h3>Local Device Storage</h3>
            <p>
              Your App preferences and usage data are stored locally on your
              device using iOS UserDefaults and Keychain Services for API keys.
              Conversation data is not permanently stored. We do not operate our
              own servers for your personal conversation data.
            </p>
            <h3>Third-Party AI Processing</h3>
            <p>
              When generating responses, your text input is temporarily sent to
              OpenAI's secure servers for processing. This data is not stored by
              us or used to train AI models. OpenAI processes this data
              according to their privacy policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Website</h3>
            <p>
              The Website is delivered over HTTPS. Hosting and font providers
              may process limited technical data (e.g., IP address) to serve the
              site and fonts.
